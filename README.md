## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I didn't learn anything new as i already know how to use html5 and css3. I was able to recap on how to use box shadows and centering a div on a page.


### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me on how to add shadows to boxes using css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Centering Div's](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to center div's on a page horizontally and vertically. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me on how to use media queries. It was really explanatory and is recommended for anyone still learning this concept.
